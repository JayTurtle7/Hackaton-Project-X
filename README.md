# Hackaton-Project-X
The idea of the project was to design in a time frame of 24 hours a web app which could be related to the theme found in the 
music "Keep ya Head Up" from 2pac. The group interpreted the song as targeting situations where a parent is abandoned to raise 
a child alone.
After consideration, the group decided to create a online community in which such parents could ask for non-financial help, 
such as searching for babysitter volunteers, private teachers and more.

This project allows the existence of an online community where the single parents can create requests of several types for 
help, and later manage them, edit them, delete them.
On the other side, people who come to help can access a web page where they can see all the existing requests, choose to help 
whichever ones they want, which then deletes the request.

The group wanted to implement several more features such as logins, more in-depth options to deal with the requests, 
login for people who want to help, however the time frame was too small for it.

If it is desired to see it working, it is necessary to active a tomcat server, set the POM correctly, and you should be able 
to test our functionalities either through postman ou directly on the web.
